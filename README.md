# ToDoList
To Do list program written in Java. Currently implemented a very basic saving/loading procedure of writing incompleted tasks to a text file and reading those tasks to recreate the TodoList. Ignore GUI class, it has been started but it has no relation to the actual program (it simply displays input text in a text field when submitted since I was learning about the basics of GUI implementation).
